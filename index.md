## High Fives and Cross Stitch

### Welcome

The primary purpose of this blog is to serve as a space where I can document my learning as I work on my passion project. I'm taking this project on as a way to try out new areas of tech that I'm not regularly exposed to, so that I can get closer to being "full stack". Along the way, I'd like to showcase the things I'm learning, and leave notes to future me about what my thought process was. I suspect it might be fun to look back on the way I was thinking about things later and see how I've grown.

If you happen to stumble across this and want to scroll through my notes, please be my guest. Just know that I am likely not an expert on any of these topics.


### Project [COMING SOON]

I would like to create a cross stitch pattern generator.

### What to Expect

Some areas that I currently plan to focus my learning time on this project include:

- Front end: a simple site running that can take in a picture and display a pattern
- Processing: a deep(ish) dive on dithering and how to make sure we are getting the best quality picture from our pattern
- Infra: Figure out how to host the site, potentially databases for storing patterns for future use
- Reliability/Observability/Security: while this not intended to be a production application, I will likely use it as a way to practice other things I want to learn.

### Template for future posts

As I said, these will primarily be for my own learning, so I am going to try to include an explanation of my learning goal along with the following

- Options I considered
- Roadblocks I ran into
- Resources I ended up using to learn and get unstuck
- Link to a git commit where I actually *did the thing*
- Pictures and/or diagrams (White board scribbles) I may have
