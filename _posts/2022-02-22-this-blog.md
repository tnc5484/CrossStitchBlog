# Welcome to the Metaverse

This page will talk about the blog itself and any major changes I make / things I am learning about my documentation and blogging journey.

## Update 2/26 - The missing post

Today I attempted to add my first post and quickly discovered that the post would not show up. After a little bit of guess and check work against [this repo](https://github.com/tnc5484/github-pages-with-jekyll/blob/main/_config.yml) I used for the tutorial, I discovered my previous themse was the culprit. For now, I am changing the theme to match the tutorial - but that sparked a todo - go find a new theme that does do what I want.
