# Front End Begins

First up, creating a very basic webpage that can take in an image and return back another image. Later the image taken in will be the image to generate a pattern for, and the image retuned will be the pattern.

## Design Decisions
This is my first time writing a React app. I chose React quite honestly because I am very new to front end development and this is what I have "the most" experince with - I completed a single tutorial during an onboarding session several years ago.

In the future, I may revisit and decide to go with something different, but for now, I am choosing React to get the project up and running.

## Resources
I'm following this [React Tutorial](https://ibaslogic.com/react-tutorial-for-beginners/) in order to get started and hopefully wrap my head around how React actually works.

## Git commit
Coming *Soon*
